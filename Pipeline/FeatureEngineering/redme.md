Featured Engineering
Feature Engineering means converting text data to numerical data. but why it is required to convert text data to numerical data?. because our machine learning model doesnâ€™t understand text data then we have to do feature engineering. This step is also called Feature extraction from text. I have already written a complete guide on Feature extraction techniques used in NLP. Click here.

In this step, we use multiple techniques to convert text to numerical vectors.

        1. One Hot Encoder
        2. Bag Of Word(BOW)
        3. n-grams
        4. Tf-Idf
        5. Word2vec
