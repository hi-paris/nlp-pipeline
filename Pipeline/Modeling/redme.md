Modelling/Model Building
In the modeling step, we try to make a model based on data. here also we can use multiple approaches to build the model based on the problem statement.

Approaches to building model â€“
1. Heuristic Approach
2. Machine Learning Approach
3. Deep Learning Approach
4. Cloud API

Here comes one question, Which approach do we have to use? Right? then this is based on two things,

1. Amount of data

2. Nature of the problem.

If we have very less data then we can not use ML or DL approach then we have to use the heuristic approach. but if we have a good amount of data then we can use a machine learning approach and if we have a large amount of data then we can use a deep learning approach.

second, based on the nature of the problem, we have to check which approach gives the best solution because if the nature of the problem changes all things get changed.
