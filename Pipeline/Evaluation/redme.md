Model Evaluation
In the model evaluation, we can use two metrics Intrinsic evaluation and Extrinsic evaluation.

Intrinsic evaluation – In this evaluation, we use multiple metrics to check our model such as Accuracy, Recall, Confusion Metrics, Perplexity, etc.

Extrinsic evaluation — This evaluation is done after deployment. This is the business-centric approach.
